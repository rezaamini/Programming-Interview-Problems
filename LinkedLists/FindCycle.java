/*
   
   Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm which returns node at
   the beginning of the loop.
   DEFINITION
   Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a nodeâ€™s next pointer
   points to an earlier node, so as to make a loop in the linked list.
   EXAMPLE
   Input: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C [the same C as earlier]
   Output: C
